## Project Description
This project was inspired by the current Covid-19 pandemic and works as a fun guide to surviving online school, with two characters who have contrasting study routines. The male character is a model student who handles online school perfectly and is part of a video tutorial on surviving online school. Meanwhile, the female character views the tutorial, but does the exact opposite of the instructions given. This character serves as a humorous parallel to the video character who has his studies figured out and we tried to create a sarcastic and entertaining video on the rather dull topic of online school. 

## Implementation Process
We had quite a significant amount of footage, so trimming the videos, choosing and positioning the cuts took a considerably long time. Normalizing the video loudness and noise was also a bit tricky, because we had videos coming from two people, a narration, as well as a background soundtrack all with different audio features, so putting them together coherently proved to be a challenge. Because we didnâ€™t talk beforehand about the design styles we were going for, the visuals of the website and the video turned out to be slightly inconsistent, with minimal blue aesthetics for the website and colorful graphics for the video elements. In terms of interactivity, we implemented what we initially planned, which is a draggable to-do list that the user is asked to arrange in order.  

## Reflection/Evaluation
Our greatest challenge by far was hosting our website on github, as our video files were too large to be loaded into the system. Only after compressing the videos, we were finally able to see a functional webpage. Aside from the technical issues, we believe we accomplished most of our initial goals, such as making an entertaining video, implementing an interactive to-do list and having a voice over narration over the story. We definitely would have achieved a lot more had there been a little more time, but we are quite satisfied with our project and had so much fun filming and editing the video, not to mention the unbearable cringe moments that ultimately made the experience all the more memorable.
